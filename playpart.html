        <h6>HELMER.</h6>
        <p>_[calls out from his room]_. Is that my little lark twittering out
        there?</p>
        <br>
        <h6>NORA.</h6>
        <p>_[busy opening some of the parcels]_. Yes, it is!</p>
        <br>
        <h6>HELMER.</h6>
        <p>Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>
        <br>
        <h6>NORA.</h6>
        <p>Yes!</p>
        <br>
        <h6>HELMER.</h6>
        <p>When did my squirrel come home?</p>
        <br>
        <h6>NORA.</h6>
        <p>Just now. _[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
        mouth.]_ Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>HELMER.</h6>
       <p> Donâ€™t disturb me. _[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
        the room, pen in hand.]_ Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
        little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>
