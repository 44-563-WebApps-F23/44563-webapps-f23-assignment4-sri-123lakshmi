    <P>
        HELMER.
        _[calls out from his room]_. Is that my little lark twittering out
        there?
        <br>
        NORA.
        _[busy opening some of the parcels]_. Yes, it is!
        <br>
        HELMER.
        Is it my little squirrel bustling about?
        <br>
        NORA.
        Yes!
        <br>
        HELMER.
        When did my squirrel come home?
        <br>
        NORA.
        Just now. _[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
        mouth.]_ Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.
        <br>
        HELMER.
        Donâ€™t disturb me. _[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
        the room, pen in hand.]_ Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
        little spendthrift been wasting money again?
